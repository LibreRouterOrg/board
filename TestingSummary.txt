Testing
--------
1. Four Ethernet ports are basically working.
Re-work required for on-board RJ45s.
PoE not able to be tested.

2. QCA9558 primary radio is basically working.
Issues with circuit error on ANT2, low TxPower output and low Rx Sensitivity.
Circuit is complex around PA and LNA chips.
Heatsinking required.

3. PCIe 5GHz radios are basically working.
Heatsinking required.

4. Serial port and Uboot console are working.

5. USB memory is detected OK as sda/sda1 and sdb/sdb1 in the two sockets.

6. GPIO testing

GPIOs 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 tested OK as simple GPIOs on I/O connectors.

GPIOs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 13  fail testing as simple GPIOs. (These have reserved functions)

GPIO 17, 23 fail  testing as a simple GPIO, but appear not to have a reserved function.
Possibly reserved by kernel code in current firmware. 

GPIO 17 drives the SWRST line but fails. Issue #14
GPIO 20 drives the USB LED, and also appears on J13 Pin 11. Issue #11
GPIO 22 drives the 2G WLAN LED 
GPIO 23 drives the STATUS LED but fails. Issue #12


7. Power consumption  (12V)

With two PCIe 5GHz radios fitted:
- 430mA with two PCIe boards and all three radios enabled.
- 390mA with 2.4GHz and one 5GHz radio enabled.
- 350mA with 2.4GHz radio only enabled.
- 250mA with all three radios disabled.

With one PCIe 5GHz radio boards installed:
- 360mA with 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios enabled

With no PCIe boards installed
- 300mA with 2.4GHz radio enabled.

8. Hardware Reset
Possible conflict with GPIO 2 line used for ATTINY hardware reset

9. Reboot
Reboot command causes board to stop, but does not restart. Requires power cycle.

10. Firmware
Not able to build/load new firmware for the board
