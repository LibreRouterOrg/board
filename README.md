## Description

![librerouter actual photo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libremesh/librerouter/master/designs/photo.jpg)

You will find two boards in the design/ folder:
* core: contains all the more integrated components, namely: cpu, memory, storage, watchdog. Facilitates the access to the pinouts of the cpu and keeps all the most integrated circuitry in one board.
* mega board: contains the peripheral connectors.

This hardware works great with the libremesh.org software.
