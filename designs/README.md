Design
======

The first designs were made with Eagle. You can find the files y the corresponding tags.

For better sharing and freedomeness of the design the CAD program was change to Kicad.

Kicad setup
-----------

For correct utilization of the local libraries a variable was defined and needs to be set before kicad execution

```
$ export LIBREROUTER_GIT_PATH=/full/git/librerouter/path/
$ kicad LibreRouter_MegaBoard.pro
```
